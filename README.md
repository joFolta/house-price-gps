### Purpose:

## How the app works:

- HTML geolocation to obtain user's latitude and longitude
- Mapbox API: reverse geolocation to convert lat/lon to raw addresses
- Parse raw address into street address, city, state
- Zillow API: input street address, city, state to output house price estimate, and other data

## Key Features

1. GPS Positioning
2. House/Neighborhood Data
3. Livability Score
4. StreetView
5. User-Authentication

- I'm in a office building and am not able to get house prices?
  - Try out "Demo Mode" from the menu drop-down to use preset address buttons to see how using it in the wild is like.

- I found a great deal! Can I buy this house today?
  - Sounds like an excellent start! Please research the specific house, loan details, and your finances before moving forward in your search for a house to call your own. To get you started with learning more about your dream house, links are provided in the House Details pages (see FAQ Q1, step 6). Prices shown are estimates only; not all houses listed are for sale. Best of luck in your search! (Me too!)

- Can I input a custom address for a house to find out its price?
  - Inputting custom addresses is a feature that did not make it into this development cycle. Send a text to the developer at 781.627.5157 to show your interest for this possible future feature.

- I have a suggestion for the next version of House Price GPS. What can I do?
  - I appreciate any feedback to learn and grow as a software engineer. Send me a text at 781.627.5157 and we can connect.

- I'd like to hire you.
  - Woaah! I appreciate that. Speak with me in person, text me at 781.627.5157, or message me on LinkedIn. Let's talk :)
